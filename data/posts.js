      "text": "Many people have been wondering how much to charge for catsitting/how much to pay catsitters. I've generally seen people charge $5/day for catsitting. That seems pretty reasonable to me. Maybe if your cat was super low-maintence or super high-maintence, you would charge a different amount, but otherwise you can't go wrong with $5."

      "text": "Guys, if you have a super high maintence cat you should pay the catsitters extra. I was helping out a friend catsit her cat today because she was out of town for an interview, and her cat peed on the carpet three separate times! I can tell you that cleaning up cat pee is not pleasant, and I'm pretty sure I smell like cat pee now. I feel like if you cat requires a lot of extra work to catsit, you should pay at least $2/day extra."

If that's an issue for you, consider getting a mouse squish toy. That way, you cat can play with a toy mouse instead of a real mouse. It's more sanitary and more healthy for the cat."
