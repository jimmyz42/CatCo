For example, \"Tuna Cat Food\" means there is 95% or more tuna in the cat food, but \"Cat Food with Tuna\" means there is only 3% tuna!!!!!! Don't get ripped off like I did...",

In fact, it works a bit <i>too</i> well, because my cat can't find her litter box anymore, so she sometimes just pees on the floor :( But it's okay, my room still smells fresher than before!",

Just having a cardboard box isn't enough. You need to provide your cat with a warm, comfortable basket or mat to sleep on, and have the proper bedding to keep him or her warm through the night.",

That seems pretty reasonable to me. Maybe if your cat was super low-maintence or super high-maintence, you would charge a different amount, but otherwise you can't go wrong with $5."

I was helping out a friend catsit her cat today because she was out of town for an interview, and her cat peed on the carpet three separate times! I can tell you that cleaning up cat pee is not pleasant, and I'm pretty sure I smell like cat pee now. I feel like if you cat requires a lot of extra work to catsit, you should pay at least $2/day extra."

If that's an issue for you, consider getting a mouse squish toy. That way, you cat can play with a toy mouse instead of a real mouse. It's more sanitary and more healthy for the cat."

If you don't have them, your cat will scratch all your furniture, and possibly you as well. All my furniture is safe, thanks to my scratching posts, and my cat enjoys scratching his nails on it, so it keeps him occupied as well.",

If your cat swallows any of those (they are adventurous and will try to eat <i>anything</i>), they can have a serious stomach problem.",
